What are Objects in JavaScript?
Objects in JavaScript, just as in many other programming languages, can be compared to objects in real life. In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Compare it with a cup, for example. A cup is an object, with properties.

A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.

const myHonda = {
  color: "red",
  wheels: 4,
  engine: { cylinders: 4, size: 2.2 },
};
Here, we created myHonda object with color, wheels, and engine properties.
